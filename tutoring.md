One of the things I love doing is helping others achieve a goal they had set. As a result, I've decided to become a tutor. More specifically, I tutor 

## Subjects tutored

- Python (Introduction/Intermediate)
  
  - Data types and structures (both built-in and user-defined);
  
  - "Mechanics" of the language (loops, conditional statements, etc);
  
  - Object-Oriented Programming;
  
  - Data analysis/visualization packages such as Pandas and matplotlib;

- Java (Introduction)
  
  - Data types and structures (both built-in and user-defined);
    
    - Constructing user-defined data structures such as linked lists;
  
  - Basic software development using JSwing and SQL;
  
  - Object-Oriented Programming;

## Who do I tutor?

I typically tutor students at the undergraduate level, but I am able to tutor those who aren't.

## Why should you choose me?

Every session, I am to go above and beyond what you'd expect a tutor to do. It is my goal to never let you leave a session confused, upset, or lost with the problem at hand. To help counter this delimma that I often see with other tutors, I've developed my own set of PowerPoints and practice problems to help reinforce the information that was discussed inside of the tutoring session. I work _with_ you on finding methods to solve a problem rather than outright giving you the solution.

In addition, I have nearly 4 years of experience working with Python, and 2 years of working with Java.

## Do you have a contract?

**NEVER**. I dislike contracts because of that "small text". Let's be honest - no one ever reads it. However, I do have set policies which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pyr8mN4Yn1siAFHXCDWYvzTSF34MVl_VShjiKY87OuQ/edit?usp=sharing). A lot of the stuff in this FAQ-like section can be found there, including rates and billing.

## How can I get in contact with you?
